# Otto Product Classification Challenge on Kaggle
The product classification challenge was hosted by Otto on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge). This repository contains the training data, test data, the code and the result for the best submission. 

To execute the code, place the code files ('final_submission.R', 'xgboost.R', 'xgboost_with_transform.R' and 'H2O.R') alongwith the data files, train.csv and test.csv. Make sure that you have the following packages installed before executing the code:

  - xgboost 
  - h2o
  
The code is written in R. Please edit the initialization of h2o to suit your machine's RAM in H2O.R before executing the code.
 
To execute the code, run the code in final_submission.R file. It will generate an output file final_submission.csv. This output is our best submission on Kaggle for the competition.
